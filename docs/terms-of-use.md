# Zensation Terms of Use

These terms and conditions apply to the Zensation app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Piggy Apps (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service.

By downloading or using the Application, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully before using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification, extraction of source code, translation, or creation of derivative versions of the Application, or any part of it, is strictly prohibited. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider strives to ensure that the Application is useful and efficient. Therefore, they reserve the right to make changes to the Application or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. Any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.

The Application stores and processes personal data provided by you to the Service Provider to deliver the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which removes software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such actions can expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise security features, and may cause the Application to not function properly or at all.

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/legal/terms-of-use/)
- [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
- [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/)
- [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

The Service Provider is not responsible for certain aspects of the Application. Some functions require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function fully due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.

If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the Application, or other third-party charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Application, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.

Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the Application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.

In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the Application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the Application.

The Service Provider may wish to update the Application at some point. The Application is currently available on Android and iOS â€“ the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the Application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular version of your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the Application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

## Changes to These Terms and Conditions

The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-06-05.
